Hart criticized John Austin’s command theory for failing to capture the obligatory, rule-governed nature of law, arguing that Austin's model could not distinguish between being 'obliged' by a threat (the gunman) and 'having an obligation' under a recognized rule. Hart developed the Rule of Recognition (RoR) as a secondary rule to address the uncertainty of primary rules. The RoR is accepted by officials as a matter of social practice.",
