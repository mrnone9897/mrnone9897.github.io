The Court held that while Parliament can amend any provision, it cannot destroy the 'basic structure' or 'framework' of the Constitution. This doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its core identity despite political pressures for drastic change.",

UOI*, the 'procedure established by law' under Article 21 must be 'fair, just, and reasonable,' giving the provision a substantive dimension akin to American 'due process.' Article 14 permeates all state action, demanding non-arbitrariness.",

                passage: "The Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection Law) penalizes legislators for voluntarily giving up party membership or voting against the party whip. In *Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu* (1992), the Supreme Court upheld the Schedule but subjected the Speaker's decision on disqualification to judicial review. The Court held the Speaker acts as a tribunal, and their decision is final unless vitiated by mala fides, perversity, or violation of natural justice.",

What was the constitutional flaw in the Tenth Schedule (Para 7) that the Supreme Court struck down?", options: ["It permitted disqualification for voting against the party.", "It barred judicial review of the Speaker's decision.", "It allowed the President to interfere in the process.", "It defined 'political party' too narrowly."], correct: 1 },

A ground for judicial review of the Speaker’s decision is:", options: ["The decision being politically incorrect.", "The member being a close relative of the Speaker.", "The decision being based on mala fides or perversity.", "The decision being appealed by the Governor."], correct: 2 },

                passage: "Hans Kelsen's Pure Theory sees law as a hierarchy of norms culminating in the presupposed **Grundnorm**, which is the ultimate source of validity. H.L.A. Hart's Analytical Positivism sees law as a union of primary and secondary rules. Hart's **Rule of Recognition (RoR)** is a 'social fact'—it exists because officials accept and follow it, unlike Kelsen’s hypothetical, non-empirical Grundnorm.",

                passage: "Lon L. Fuller, a natural law theorist, argued that law requires an 'inner morality,' meaning laws must meet eight procedural standards (like promulgation, clarity, consistency) to qualify as true law. Ronald Dworkin, a critic of positivism, argued that law consists not only of rules but also of 'principles' that have a dimension of weight. Dworkin asserts that individual rights act as 'trumps' against policy arguments that appeal to collective welfare.",

Section 81 (Necessity) protects an act done by the accused to avoid a greater harm, provided the lesser harm caused was non-malicious. The general principle *actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea* (an act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty) underscores the necessity of *mens rea* for most offenses, though strict liability offenses are exceptions. The burden of proving a General Exception lies on the accused (Section 105, Evidence Act), though it only needs to be proven by a preponderance of probabilities.",
